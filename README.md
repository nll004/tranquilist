## Assignment
**Capstone Project 1**

We were given the opportunity to create a fully functioning app utilizing an api of choice.

Written task lists often get misplaced, outdated and messy. Other task management apps come with cluttered displays, annoying alerts and reminders as well as strict timelines that I find impractical and annoying for everyday tasks.

Being obsessed with organization and task lists yet often irritated by constant reminders and alerts, Iâ€™ve reimagined my task list to provide a place to store everyday tasks while still utilizing the Google Calendar for events that require a strict time requirement.

This task manager calls Google Calendar API to display upcoming events and holidays using Oauth2.0 and a smaller simple API for motivational quotes.

Google Calendar API: https://developers.google.com/calendar/api

Motivational Quote API: https://rapidapi.com/bitbiscuit-bitbiscuit-default/api/motivational-quotes1/details

## To Do
At a later date I plan to introduce more features like editing, completing, deleting subtasks.
